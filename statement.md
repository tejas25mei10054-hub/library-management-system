Problem Statement
Managing a library manually involves challenges such as loss of records, slow search and retrieval, inefficient tracking of issued books, and difficulty managing users and book inventories. This project aims to automate the library system to improve accuracy, efficiency, and ease of book and user management.

Scope of the Project
The system manages books by storing details like title, author, and ISBN. It supports adding, searching, deleting, issuing, and returning books. It also handles user registration and tracks issued books. The scope includes a command-line interface for basic library operations without persistent storage or GUI.
